# Advanced-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Deep-Learning-and-Attention-Mechanisms
This project builds a multivariate time-series forecasting model using LSTM with a self-attention mechanism. It includes synthetic data generation, preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, model training, baseline comparison, and evaluation using RMSE and MAE to show attention’s forecasting improvements
